- Responsive design to ensure usability on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content rendering and interactivity.

### JavaScript

The `script.js` file includes:
- A frozen object `myFavoriteFootballTeam` that holds team and player data.
- Functions to render player cards dynamically.
- Event listeners to handle dropdown menu changes and update displayed players.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Interact with the dropdown menu to filter players based on:
   - **All Players**: Show all players.
   - **Nicknames**: Show players with nicknames.
   - **Position Filters**: Show players by their position (Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper).
